# Excel-Dashboard
This project uses a Bike Buyers dataset to create an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel. The dashboard provides insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior, and allows users to explore the data dynamically.

Key Features:
Dashboard: Includes 3 distinct charts for data visualization:

Chart 1: Average Income per Purchase – displays the average income of customers who made bike purchases.
Chart 2: Customer Commute – shows the commute distances of customers in relation to bike purchases.
Chart 3: Customer Age Brackets – visualizes the distribution of bike buyers across different age groups.

Slicers: Enables filtering and drilling down into the data with 3 different slicers:

Slicer 1: Marital Status – filter data based on whether the customer is married or single.
Slicer 2: Region – filter by geographic region to explore regional differences in bike purchases.
Slicer 3: Education – filter by the customer's education level.
